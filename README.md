Industrial Village is a tech-based colony-managing modpack centered around the Immersive Engineering and Minecolonies mods. It offers a progressive gameplay experience where players start by gathering flint to craft their first pickaxe and gradually advance to building complex and immersive multiblock machines and thriving self-sufficient colonies.

**Some notable features include:**

- Immersive Engineering: The modpack heavily focuses on the Immersive Engineering mod, which introduces a wide range of technological elements and machines. Players can utilize waterwheels, windmills, an excavator with a large rotating bucket wheel, hanging powerlines, diesel generators and handheld mining drills to create advanced machinery.
- Advanced Technologies: As you delve deeper into the modpack, you will discover the power of Pneumatic systems that will allow you to utilize compressed air to power various machines and devices. You will have the ability to build and launch rockets, explore other planets and uncover new resources and challenges in the vastness of space; create controlled environments to spawn and farm mobs automatically, providing a convenient source of resources and experience. To protect your base you can make use of a modular forcefield system. This technology allows for the creation of customizable forcefields that can defend against unauthorized entry, projectiles, and other threats.
- Rule your colony: In MineColonies, you have the opportunity to establish your own colony and exert control over its citizens. Your citizens will follow your instructions to construct buildings, gather resources, and upgrade existing structures. As the leader, you will have the power to plan and command their actions, shaping the development of your colony according to your desires.
- Expanded Gameplay: Industrial Village goes beyond technology by offering a variety of additions in different aspects of the game. It includes extra building blocks, allowing creative architects to construct intricate and unique structures. Players can also find additional food options, new seeds, and various options for decoration.
- Exploration and Secrets: While the pack focuses on technology, exploration remains an integral part of the gameplay. Players are encouraged to venture into the world and discover secret hidden features, structures, and potentially even new dimensions. This adds an exciting element of discovery to the modpack.
